Compile with "preProcessor.cpp", "article.h", "featureVector.h" and "listIO.h" in the same directory usign the command "g++ -o <outputFile> preProcessor.cpp".

The program is designed to run without command line input. The default directory to read reuters from is "/home/0/srini/WWW/674/public/reuters/". Default settings can be changed by declaring a file named "settings.cfg" and liststing settings, one per line, in the form: 

	 <setting name>="<value>"

Default settings are as follows:

	int upperFreqCutoff = 900
	int lowerFreqCutoff = 110
	int ldStopWords = 1
	int ldIgnoreWords = 0
	int makeVector1 = 1
	int makeVector2 = 0
	int writeVector1 = 1
	int writeVector2 = 1
	int writeIgnoreWords = 1
	int writeWordList = 1
	int askForFreqCutoff = 1
	int numBins = 100
	string reuterDir = "/home/0/srini/WWW/674/public/reuters/"

This program can read stop words from a file named "stopWords.lst" and a custom list of words to ignore from a file named "ignoreWords.lst". Feature vectors reside in memory and can be written to files named "vector1" and "vector2".
